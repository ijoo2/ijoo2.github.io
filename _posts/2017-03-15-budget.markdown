<p>So over the past few months, I've been a lot more aware of where my money is going and in finances in general.</p>

<p>When I was back home in Chicago earlier this year, I was talking to my older brother about finances, and that's when I realized that I spent over *13k* dollars on food over the past 12 months.</p>

<p>Wow! That's almost 1.1k a month! Granted, this does include alcohol and bars, but that is only a fraction of my expenses. The software I used to budget/track my expenses is <a href="https://www.mint.com/"> Mint.</a> I highly recommend Mint, but I have heard that <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/"> YNAB (You Need a Budget)</a> is a great alternative.</p>

<p>My older brother mentioned that he spent around 13k one specific year as well on food, but did stress that it was way too much. But now that lucky bastard works for Google, he gets free breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so his food expenses have been greatly reduced. Everyone including friends and family have been telling me that 13k one year is a ridiculous number (except for my current roommate, but I think he likes to live a lot more lavishly than I do).</p>

<p>The most significant getaway from this is that it is ridiculously easy to spend money, and little things do add up. Feeling lazy at home? Let's order takeout or delivery. How about an Americano or an iced coffee to start off the morning grind? While they may seem significantly small ($3-5), regular small purchases definitely matter in the end. Fortunately, the last month (Feb 2017) has been my best month over the past 12 months in terms of food expenses, although I was more aware of the issue. Let's hope March is even better!</p>
