<p>So over the past few months, I've been a lot more aware of where my money is going and in finances in general.</p>

<p>When I was back home in Chicago earlier this year, I was talking to my older brother about finances, and that's when I realized that I spent over *13k* dollars on food over the past 12 months.</p>

<p>Wow! That's almost 1.1k a month! Granted, this does include alcohol and bars, but that is only a fraction of my expenses. The software I used to budget/track my expenses is <a href="https://www.mint.com/"> Mint.</a> I highly recommend Mint, but I have heard that <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/"> YNAB (You Need a Budget)</a> is a great alternative.</p>

<p>My older brother mentioned that he spent around 13k one specific year as well on food, but did stress that it was way too much. But now that lucky bastard works for Google, he gets free breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so his food expenses have been greatly reduced. Everyone including friends and family have been telling me that 13k one year is a ridiculous number (except for my current roommate, but I think he likes to live a lot more lavishly than most I do).</p>

<p>The most significant getaway from this is that it is ridiculously easy to spend money, and little things do add up. That one little Americano outside the office does stack up in the end. Feeling lazy at home? Why not buy takeout or delivery? Fortunately, the last month (Feb 2017) has been my best month over the past 12 months in terms of food expenses, althought I definitely was a lot more aware of the issue. Let's hope March is even better!</p>
