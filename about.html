<p>Hi! </p>

<p> I'm Inha - or Nick. Software engineer, creator, thinker, traveler, and a professional napper based in Seattle, WA. But more than anything else I love to talk, and that's what this is for. I have an excess of thoughts backlogged in my memory that I would like to release instead of having them get wasted on my showerhead or unfortunate friends. </p>

<p> I'm currently an SDE at Amazon on the AWS Fraud Prevention team. Basically a superhero fighting crime. </p>
